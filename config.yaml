dataAnalysis:
 calCorrection: False  # In the event that your xDrip does not correct readings after a spot calibration
 loadMealResp: True    # Glucose Response Graphs will be saved to the outputFileDirectory.  They can also be launched in the browser.

 sleepCorr: True       # Sleep Data will be used to show potential correlations with glucose response
 exerciseCorr: True    # Exercise Data will be used to show potential correlations with glucose response and added to meal response graphs
 biometricCorr: True   # biometricMetrics from cronometer will be used to show potential correlations with glucose response
 matplotlib: False     # A step response via matplotlib for each meal above 5 carbs
 bokeh: True           # A step response via BOKEH for each meal above 5 carbs
 heat: True            # A heat map covering the entire duration window
 multiplot: True       # A single plot with all step responses shown.
 biometricCorr: True   # Will produce plots showing step responses for biometrics shown below.  Must match output
 supplementCorr: True  # Will produce plots showing step resonses for Supplements of interest shown below. String must match output

Biometrics:
  - Blood Pressure    #must match string found in biometrics.csv

Supplements:
  - creatine         #must match string found in servings/meal data

adjustments:
  calWindow: 5    # If you are adjusting the data for calibration, this will adjust and smooth values over this number of hours minutes and seconds.
